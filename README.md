# `{pokemon}`

The aim of the `{pokemon}` package is to be able to pull in data from PokéAPI ([API](https://pokeapi.co/), [R Package](https://github.com/ashbaldry/pokeapi)) and be able to create a team of Pokémon and fight against random teams, a friend or run damage calculations.

## Installation

```r
remotes::install_github("ashbaldry/pokemon")

**NB** This package uses the developmental [R7](rconsortium/OOP-WG) class.
